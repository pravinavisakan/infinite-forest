Advanced Topics covered:

Perlin noise, height map generation, L-systems, frustum culling.

Perlin noise was used to generate a height map upon which trees were placed. The trees in question followed a set of rules or grammar (L-systems), either an algae or a binary tree. Other grammars were explored but not fully developed.

We found that loading multiple OBJ files into one vertex buffer caused massive lag.

We had great difficulty in making everything work together, and using git to keep track of branches and commits was difficult to handle.



Brandon: Binary tree/l-systems
